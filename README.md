## Goal

Embark on a journey to the door at the end of the level.

On your way you'll find enemies- avoid them. They'll make
you lose hearts.



## Currency
Along the way, you'll encounter coins. Picking up bronze coins will get you more
than picking up gold coins.



## Enemies
### Slimes
These bad boys haven't been fed in 2 years. I saved them up just for you.

### FlyMan (Guy Thing???)
The equivalent to a chad. He loves buffing his wings and won't stop for you to get them.



## Controls

WASD + Arrow Key friendly!
